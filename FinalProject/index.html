          <h3>What I learned</h3>
          <p>I have learned about many things and writing html scripts is one of them. Although it had been a rough year and an unusual semester, I was able to learn a lot through the weekly voicethreads like how face recognition, how autonomous vehicles work, how CS started and etc. </p>

          <h3>What I have relearned</h3>
          <p>Throughout this semester there were many times that I have relearned something. In my math and english courses were where I relearned a lot of things. In my Math courses I relearned some basic algebra skills. In my english courses, I have relearned basic sentence structure, why brainstorming is useful, reviewed the MLA formatting just in case and many other basic writing skills.</p>

          <h3>Expectations</h3>
          <p>My expectations for this semester was very high and in some courses they really were high while others were not as hard as I was expecting. As long as I was doing what was required and completing them, everything was smooth sailing.</p>
